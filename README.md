**What is this?**

Some dockerfiles I made for Richard Chesterwood's course [Docker - Hands On for Java Developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-hands-on/). The webapps are not mine!

**What did I learn?**

- Various Docker concepts: Containers, volumes, images, stacks, etc.
- Container management and networking
- How to write neat dockerfiles 
- Docker Swarm
- Docker Compose
- How to deploy containers (with Spring microservices) in different scenarios with EC2

**How was the course?**

Pretty good! I learned a lot about Docker and I'm now capable of tinkering with containers fairly easily.

**Additional info**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
